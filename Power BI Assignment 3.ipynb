    "## 1.\tExplain the advantages of Natural Queries in PowerBi with an example?\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural Queries allow users to ask questions in plain language to retrieve data and generate visualizations. The advantages include accessibility for non-technical users, faster data exploration, and ease of use. For example, a user could ask, \"Show me the sales revenue by region for the last quarter,\" and Power BI would generate a relevant chart based on this natural language query.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.\tExplain Web Front End(WFE) cluster from Power BI Service Architecture?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Web Front End (WFE) cluster in Power BI Service Architecture handles user requests and interactions with Power BI reports and dashboards through web browsers and mobile apps. It serves as the user interface layer, managing authentication, authorization, and user sessions. The WFE cluster ensures that users can access and interact with reports and dashboards securely and efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.\tExplain Back End cluster from Power BI Service Architecture?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Back End cluster in Power BI Service Architecture is responsible for data processing, data modeling, and query execution. It manages data storage, refreshes, and transformations. The Back End cluster ensures that data is processed, cached, and optimized for efficient retrieval, allowing users to access and analyze data in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.\tWhat ASP.NET component does in Power BI Service Architecture?\n",
    "\n",
    "The ASP.NET component in Power BI Service Architecture is responsible for handling web requests, routing them to the appropriate clusters (WFE or Back End), and managing the overall web application framework. It plays a crucial role in serving the Power BI web application to users and facilitating communication between various components.\n",
